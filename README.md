# Signature-Forgery-Detection-System-using-CNN-

**Project Title:** Signature Forgery Detection

**Description:**
The Signature Forgery Detection project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to distinguish between genuine and forged signatures. The system provides a user-friendly interface where users can upload an image of a signature for verification. Upon upload, the system preprocesses the image, extracts relevant features, and applies a trained CNN model to predict the authenticity of the signature.

**Key Features:**
1. **User-friendly Interface:** Streamlit-powered interface allows users to easily upload signature images.
2. **Signature Verification:** Utilizes a trained CNN model to analyze uploaded signatures and provide real-time verification results.
3. **Preprocessing:** Images are preprocessed to ensure consistency and compatibility with the CNN model.
4. **Automated Folder Management:** Automatically creates folders for verification and preprocessed images, ensuring efficient organization of data.

**Technologies Used:**
- TensorFlow and Keras for CNN model development and training.
- OpenCV for image processing tasks such as resizing and normalization.
- Streamlit for building the user interface.
- Matplotlib for visualizing images and prediction results.

**Benefits:**
- Provides a reliable solution for detecting signature forgeries, aiding in fraud prevention.
- Easy-to-use interface makes it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
- Automates the preprocessing and verification process, saving time and effort for users.
